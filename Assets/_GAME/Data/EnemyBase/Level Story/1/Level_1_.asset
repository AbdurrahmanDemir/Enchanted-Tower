  cardDescription: 'A grand meeting was held in the mountain strongholds of House
    Crow Claw. Crown Prince Kaelen Ravenshadow, commanders, and advisors gathered.
    The agenda included news from the sacred gates, the rise of bandits in the borderlands,
    and the rise of mysterious magic.

    

    House Crow Claw''s goal now became
    the capital.

    

    But this path would require fighting not only the armies
    of the enemy house, but also bandits, lost armies, and ancient curses.'
